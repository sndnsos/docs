## \[ 2023 ] Played



Recently, I have been thinking about how to judge the quality of the games.\
So even though I don't have any favorite games this year, I am trying to follow the activity of TGA.

For me, there are five attributes to judge games.

* Playability
* Story
* Vision - Visual Art, Graphic Effect
* Audio - Score and Music, Sound Effect
* Creativity

I will try to give scores of games in the four attributes.\
For every attribute, I give scores from 0 to 10.

### **Baldur's Gate 3（博德之門3）\[2023] \[99/100]**

A pretty nice game.

Fully Voiced. An excellent game to study English and enjoy the strategies and story.

### Darkest Dungeon II （暗黑地牢2） \[2023] \[93/100]

This game is really addictive,

but you have to fail many times to become stronger to win later :(

I tried to use copy/paste the save file to save time, also with the inventory mods. So I saved much time to finish the walkthrough of this game, but still, it took me more than 20 hours.

### Darkest Dungeon （暗黑地牢） \[2016] \[94/100]

I only played it for hours because I didn't have enough time.

### South of the Circle （極圈以南） \[2020] \[58/100]

A special game, but the story is kind of insane.

* P: 1&#x20;
* S: 3&#x20;
* V: 8&#x20;
* A: 6&#x20;
* C: 7

### Atomic Heart （原子之心） \[2023] \[93/100]

* P: 6
* S: 9
* V: 8
* A: 7
* C: 8

### Forspoken （魔咒之地） \[2023] \[85/100]

The running and fighting part of this game has some fun, while the story is very boring and the game is not actually a complete game.

* P: 6
* S: 5
* V: 5
* A: 4
* C: 5

### Jianghu 11 （江湖11） \[2022] \[39/100]

This is a trash game. It looks interesting at the beginning when you try. But it's so boring if you have tried. It only has a framework but no soul.

### Breakout 13 （飛越13號房） \[2023] \[71/100]

A good topic, though the game quality is not good.

But I like one speech it says "We won't be truly away, unless we overthrow it with our own hands"

* P: 4.5
* S: 6
* V: 6
* A: 4
* C: 7

## \[ 2019 - 2022 ] Played

### Dark and Darker (Beta Version) \[2023] \[88/100]

A good mode of games. It could be fun but also time-wasting.

### Florence \[2018] \[81/100]&#x20;

* P: 0
* S: 7
* V: 8
* A: 8.5
* C: 7

The playability of this game gets a 0 score for me (actually I regard it as negative), but the visual art and music are both good.&#x20;

Also, the story can be very common to the relationships of many people. It reminds me something of my own experience. Florence...

### Hindsight （後見之明） \[2022] \[94/100]

* P: 7
* S: 9
* V: 8
* A: 7.5
* C: 9

The best game for me this year. The story is not special, but I like the way it tells the story and I get and love the feeling inside this game.

### A Memoir Blue/ˈmem.wɑːr/ \[2022] \[68/100]

* P: 3
* S: 3.5
* V: 7
* A: 6.5
* C: 7.5

I don't like the game. The story is tough and bad to feel. It takes too many device resources as well.

### Card Survival: Tropical Island \[2022] \[89/100]

* P: 8
* S: 4
* V: 4
* A: 6
* C: 8

This game is fun at the beginning when you try, but it's boring and a waste of time later if you keep going.

### The Invisible Guardian（隱形守護者）\[2019] \[49/100]

Some people who know the real history of China are saying the original game 「潜伏之赤途」 is a better game.&#x20;

I haven't played 「潜伏之赤途」, but I dislike 「隱形守護者」(this game) for many reasons. There are some details showing that the game designer also knows it is It is just a political show which is full of lies as propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party. I can't say everyone in the Communist Party is a bad guy, but CCP is even 10 times worse than the Japanese during the second world war.&#x20;

However, I finally accept and support the viewpoint that Chinese people deserve the Chinese Communist Party, their moralities are as bad as each other, so there are so many disasters after 1949 and people felt like nothing. : ) But still, I feel very disgusted.

Also, many scenarios are not logical. Sometimes, it is even like a 抗日神劇（ridiculous anti-Japanese drama). By the way, it talked a lot about the place Yanan（延安）, as if it seems like a sacred place with faith. But it is just a purgatory full of demons, deceits, and intrigues.&#x20;

Again, the game is really so so so fake and untruthful. I could talk for 100 hours about how stupid the game is, worse than bullshit.

### The Scroll Of Taiwu（太吾繪卷）\[2022] \[73/100]&#x20;

This game was one of the very rare Chinese games I kinda liked. It has some very interesting ideas.

But it is also bad for many reasons:

* Too many bugs, some are fatal bugs that can lead the game crashes; some are very terrible bugs that could make your character's data go to breaking bad values and you can barely play any future. **I am saying the bugs made you have to stop playing the games or restart the games.**&#x20;
* A very awful UI design and a terrible playing experience. It becomes very tiring for users to play this game without installing mods.
* Stupid stories, I thought there could be an awesome ending that could make everything kind of worthy, but the ending was actually pretty boring and has nothing meaningful in it.
* Pretty laggy if you play for a long time.
* This game regards itself as a Wuxia game. Wuxia is a concept that is called "Doing the good things, Promises must be kept and action must be resolute" （「言必信，行必果」）. But in the game, you can't really feel that people are doing good things. (Actually, if you have played this game and understood the behaviors of the player, you would better call the character a bad person). But in fact, Wuxia is also only a fake imaginary concept in China. Chinese people won't even try to help kids and old people who fall down on the street. Justice and Righteous is what&#x20;
* Cheating - 3 years after EA, this game is not really getting better. And with so many issues, it calls the game itself.

I am not saying this game won't be better after several years. I  can be. But I have too many reasons to dislike it right now (2022/09/22)

### The Last of Us（最後生還者）\[2013] \[81/100]

* Season 1 - \[93/100]
* Season 2 - \[53/100]: The story and character design are too self-contradictory and too stupid, it ruined other good works to make the game a trash disgusting game.

### 🥰The Walking Dead（行屍走肉） \[2012] \[97/100]

It's always ridiculous for zombie-related stories. It looks like there are 70 trillion zombies on the earth being able to survive forever without anything. \
But this game is the best of all.

* Season 1 - \[98/100]
* Season 2 - \[94/100]
* Season 3 - \[92/100]
* Season 4 - \[90/100]

### Wartales（戰爭傳說） \[2022] \[90/100]

For something, it's fun, but also boring for the fights.

### V Rising （吸血鬼：崛起） \[2022] \[93/100]

### **The Wolf Among Us（**我們身邊的狼 \~ 與狼同行**）\[2013] \[95/100]**

### **Heavy Rain（暴雨）\[2010] \[94/100]**

### 🥰 What Remains of Edith Finch （**伊迪·芬奇的記憶**）\[2017] \[98/100]

One of the best games ever! 🥰

### Big Time \[2022] \[39/100]

### To the Moon（去月球）\[2011] \[94/100]

### Quarantineer（隔離之名）\[2021] \[90/100]

It's great to make friends with the designer of this game.

I appreciate it a lot.

### Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery（傾聽畫語:最美好的景色）\[2021] \[91/100]

### Portal 2（傳送門2）\[2011] \[97/100]

### Age of Empires IV（帝國時代4）\[2021] \[88/100]

### New World\[MMO]（新世界）\[2021] \[83/100]

### LOST JUDGMENT 裁かれざる記憶\[2021] \[93/100]&#x20;

\[Wached Only]

The story is attractive. And the street view is so like Japan.

### Titan Quest（泰坦之旅）\[80/100]

### Kingdom Rush: Frontiers（王國保衛戰：前線）\[93/100]

Maybe it is the best Tower Defense game so far. It's challenging to finish all levels with 3 stars.

* Kingdom Rush - 2014
* Kingdom Rush: Frontiers - 2016
* Kingdom Rush: Origins - 2018
* Kingdom Rush: Vengeance - 2020

### Life is Strange: True Colors（奇異人生：本色）\[2021] \[91/100]

Beautiful game and beautiful journey, Free music and free souls \~

Strong empathy is sure a power. It could bring much pain. However, if more people could understand each other better, there would be fewer ugly lies and evils.

### This is the Police （這是警察）\[89/100]

### Road 96（九十六號公路）\[2021] \[93/100]

Music is touching; Scenes are beautiful; Characters are lifelike. It's about life adventure.

Lose freedom, lose all truth. It's an important thing we all should know and remember.

### Risk of Rain 2（雨中冒险2）\[89/100]

### Muck \[85/100]

### **Rim World（環世界）\[94/100]**

### 🥰It Takes Two（雙人成行）\[2021] \[97/100]

It is the best cooperative game and one of the best games I have ever experienced. Thanks for making such an interesting and creative game full of love!

It's nice to have a company and to build a lovely world.

### 🥰Cyberpunk 2077（**賽博朋克2077 |** 電馭叛客2077）\[2020] \[96/100]

No matter where we are, love & freedom are always the best things to chase.

I like this game pretty much! I like the stories a lot as well. The bugs at the beginning of this game are not very influential actually.

### Grand Theft Auto V （俠盜獵車手）\[95/100]

### Dota2 \[Defense of the Ancients] \[95/100]

My favorite heroes are still tinker and techies in this game.

### **The Legend of Sword and Fairy（仙劍奇俠傳）\[76/100]**

This game has some special meanings to many Chinese. (I was but I am not Chinese)

But I really have many reasons to dislike this game.&#x20;

### Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV 三國志14 \[73/100] <a href="#firstheading" id="firstheading"></a>

### **Fall Guys（糖豆人）\[88/100]**

### **ARK: Survivel Evolved（**方舟：進化生存）\[92/100]
