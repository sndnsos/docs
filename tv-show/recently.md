-- I don't know why I cried many times on this show.  
-- No, I know.  
I like to see people have beautiful lives especially with each other.  
I miss the feeling of love. I wish I could have it.

> I hope only love and happiness will remain.

### Liar Game 

### Girl from Nowhere

This TV series may seem absurd but it's so real. There are both good and evil in humanity. Even a small lie can grow to be a nightmare.

### Squid Game

### Dream of the Red Chamber

### Money Heist
