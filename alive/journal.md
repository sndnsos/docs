## 2022

I live alone with bearly nobody to talk with every day.

But still, I have some good times.

**May 28**

I remember that was  May 28, one of the best beautiful nights I have had in my life. I was sitting on a small beach, watching the sunset. Some wind, a little cooler but felt nice. There was no star in the sky when it turned dark.

this year, sometimes I went out to the beach, to seek some peace from nature. It is not a special day, and I felt lonely that day too, but suddenly, I just felt so nice to enjoy that moment. Sitting on a chair on the beach, listening to some music, enjoying the weather and temperature, having a free feeling and a free soul. The happiness could be very simple like this moment.

**Sep 6**

Today is a windy day, and it rains. I opened my windows, the wind is so comfortable. Outside of my house are two trees, one of which has pink flowers still blooming.

I sit in front of my computer, reading some articles from someone I feel respectful to but gone forever. I am alive and I feel this could be one of the best afternoons I could have. Very simple, but very enjoyable.
