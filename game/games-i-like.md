# Games I like

### LOST JUDGMENT 裁かれざる記憶 \[96/100\]

The story is attractive. And the street view is so like Japan.

### Kingdom Rush Frontiers \[95/100\]

Maybe it is the best Tower Defense game so far.

### Life is Strange: True Colors \[90/100\]

Strong empathy is sure a power. It could bring much pain. However, if more people could understand each other better, there would be fewer ugly lies and evils.

### Road 96 \[92/100\]

Lose freedom, lose all truth.

### It Takes Two \[97/100\]

It's nice to have a company and to build a lovely world.
